           The process involves understanding the semantics of the prompt, generating relevant lyrics, identifying the musical genre, and composing melodic and harmonic elements to create the final song. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          ◦ The methodology is divided into three main stages: Lyric Generation from Textual Prompts, Genre Classification of the Lyrics, and Chord Progression Generation Conditioned on Lyrics and Genre.
          
          ◦ Lyric Generation from Textual Prompts - Fine-tuned LLMs (FlanT5 and Llama models) generate lyrics from encoded prompts, with the LLM fine-tuned on a lyrics-prompt dataset for three epochs.
          
          ◦ Genre Classification of the Lyrics - Pre-trained models (BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa) are fine-tuned for genre classification to classify the generated lyrics.
          
          ◦ Chord Progression Generation Conditioned on Lyrics and Genre - Combines a two-stage encoder-decoder model (DistilBERT and LSTM) with reinforcement learning (RLHF) to generate chord progressions based on lyrical context.
